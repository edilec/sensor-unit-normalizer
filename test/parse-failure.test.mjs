/**
 * A readings file that cannot be parsed must not be republished by its own
 * diagnostic.
 *
 * V8 reports a parse failure two ways, and one of them quotes the input back:
 * `Unexpected token 'A', "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" is not valid JSON`. The quoted
 * run is the first ten characters of the document, or the whole document when
 * it is shorter, so a file short enough to be nothing but a credential is
 * reproduced in full by its own error message. `normalize` interpolated that
 * message whole onto stderr -- on the error path, which is the path a
 * malformed or misnamed file is guaranteed to take.
 *
 * The canary is `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`, the access key id AWS publishes in its
 * own documentation. It is not a credential; it is the shape of one.
